#
# Provide symbolic debugging, single stepping, breakpoints.

# TODO
# symbol access will be done via symtab
# will need a source path to the source module to get labels and source lines
# will need a command line interface prompt to accept commands
# will build around the simulator to actually execute commands

# API
# each of the facilities in CLI and UI will be realised by accessing this API

# CLI
# a simple gdb like interface (bit like our harpsim)
# command line parser with arguments

# UI
# like a really simple version of the atmel studio
# variable watches
# memory dump
# register dump
# set and get register values
# single step
# breakpoints
# disassembly
